# CobraFX
My shaders for ReShade are saved here.

Gravity.fx is a shader which lets Pixels gravitate towards the bottom of the screen.
Don't forget to include the texture inside the Textures folder!

Colorsort.fx is a compute shader, which sorts colors from brightest to darkest.
It does only work inside the current ReShade Beta you can build yourself as described here: https://github.com/crosire/reshade#building
Also it will only work with DirectX 11 or newer.
